# Short description
This ROS package has been developed to collect data from 1) a Hokuyo lidar (20 Hz), 2) a Phidgets IMU (250 Hz), 3) a camera (~20 fps), 4) 
a GPS sensor (1 Hz), and 5) a flag button. In the [DIV project](http://divproject.eu), this data logger was used to collect data on road.
A pedestrian wore the equipment and overtaking manoeuvres of vehicles were collected.
